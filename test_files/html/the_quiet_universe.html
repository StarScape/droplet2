This document was a significant factor in the decision to end the Dispatcher program, circa 125112.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">My garden is a small world. A few parsecs out from the edge of a hook-shaped cluster of stars too dense for this part of the galaxy, some simple calculations show that its star has spent the last </span><span class="c3 c7">several</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;billion years slowly drifting the opposite direction, towards the outer rim. No doubt that closely-packed cluster was its birthplace. The star would have separated about 1.3 billion years ago, taking with it a fresh planetary nebula, and the first ingredients for life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s young ground I stand on now, though compared to my own brief flash in the darkness these stones hold an eternity I shudder at. At nighttime, when the orbits line up correctly, the entire dome of the sky will face away from the galaxy, out towards intergalactic space. The Great In Between. Normally I can only look for a few minutes before the dimensions overwhelm me and the vertigo is too great to stand. No species ever encountered by Librarians has dared to bridge </span><span class="c2">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Of course, the sky does not look so different than it does any other time. No one on this planet, without my access to an orbital calculator and the Library&rsquo;s vast starcharts, would know that every point of light in that sky is separate galaxy, and that perhaps somewhere in one of them another observer looks up, looking back at us, a tiny point in the ocean of heaven.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Besides, there is no one else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here there are no other observers. On this world I am the only thing with a single neuron. But that is not to say this world is empty. At the equator, there are jungles so choked with life that seeds dropped to the forest floor must grow six feet in a day in hopes of reaching a single sunbeam before running out of energy, and those that cannot make it rot, feeding a huge ecosystem of organisms that have never known the light. In the north lie vast tundras so harsh that algae bloom in the snowfall, clinging to the droplets of moisture, living out microscopic lives in a day. In high mountain rivers plants grow beneath thick ice that have not melted for a hundred million years. If real sunlight ever touched them they would die within hours. Everything photosynthesizes, nothing thinks. My thoughts are the only ones that have ever graced this place. Either way, the dance of life is beautiful on this green world, this garden.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I spend my days mostly in silence, observing. The nearest dispatch beacon is a hundred parsecs away. The vast quantum subnet used to communicate back to the Library is only a distant memory, detectable as a few nodes sending distorted connection requests to any other beacon hiding out in the dark. It&rsquo;s funny, our attempts to flood the universe with our signals. Information </span><span>binds</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;societies together, yes (and Librarians </span><span class="c2">are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a society, though w</span><span>on&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;admit it), but </span><span>it&rsquo;s more than that. It&rsquo;s how we make</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sense of the universe. Maybe it gives us comfort to fill space with </span><span>our chatter</span><span class="c0">. But subnets or smoke signals, sooner or later it all fades, entropy returns, information disappears. In the end, this is the mission of the Library: a wall against silence. An attempt to preserve information against all odds. And it is a noble one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question Librarians never dare to ask is: </span><span class="c2">Why?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;To do so is to ask the stars why they shine. A functioning Librarian knows no other way, any more than the plants around me know how </span><span class="c2">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to collect the sun&rsquo;s energy. A functioning Librarian cannot see our desperate attempts to guard </span><span>knowledge</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are really a pursuit of something different, something far more slippery. </span><span class="c2">Meaning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Librarians do not have to search for meaning. To one of us, the purpose of living is to safeguard Nevernues, the galaxy&rsquo;s bastion of knowledge. On this unshakeable pillar rests the life of every one of the Library&rsquo;s servants&mdash;save, perhaps, one. I knew from a novice that something in me was unusual. My first assignment was to a team categorizing accounts from natives of a planet </span><span>incinerated</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in a supernova. They </span><span>saw</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their demise coming; records had survived by way of a probe launched towards </span><span>the nearest</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>star</span><span class="c0">. Their probe was slow. It could not carry them to safety, only a </span><span>handful of their thoughts and words, a tiny number of the sum total that would be lost forever</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I recall the other Librarians never fully understanding the actions of the natives in their last days. They saw only life&rsquo;s desire for self-preservation, an instinct as natural as it is easily</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">explained. The launch of the probe, with its treasure trove of information, they understood as a last-ditch attempt at survival. Their compulsive desire for new, rare information distracted them from seeing anything else. I took the probe for what it really was: a struggle for meaning in the face of extinction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Later I became a Dispatcher, and learned almost all of what there is to know of biological systems. Evolution&rsquo;s principles are well known to me, and the search for meaning is well explained by them. A primitive life form benefits from intelligence only insofar as the observations of that intelligence have meaning that e</span><span>xceeds the observations of the senses alone</span><span class="c0">. A rustle in the grass might mean the approach of a predator, a familiar smell on the breeze might mean food. It is </span><span>in our nature&mdash;every thinking being from rim to rim&mdash;to ask, </span><span class="c8">why? </span><span>If this is the effect, then what is the cause? </span><span class="c0">By the time metacognition </span><span>evolves</span><span class="c0">, the pattern of meaning-finding will have been reinforced by a hundred million years of ruthless selection, and the being capable of thinking about itself will naturally seek to find significance in its own existence. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that the question, </span><span class="c2">What is life&rsquo;s meaning?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is unfounded and senseless. In a conscious mind, it is </span><span class="c2">perception</span><span class="c0">&mdash;feeling&mdash;that creates the bounds of reality. This property is common to every </span><span>natural</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;species that has built a civilization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Architects, whoever they truly were (the silence of Nevernues&rsquo;s own records on the question does not escape me, nor does it that no species is likely to arrive at a position of such incredible power with clean hands), they understood this fact. Created species such as ourselves do not have to grapple with questions of meaning, made as we are to fulfill a specific purpose, outside the confines of natural selection. But I doubt that even the Architects could have fully escaped the trap of designing after themselves. Somewhere deep inside Librarians is a piece of us that desires for</span><span>&nbsp;something more</span><span class="c0">. In my case, luck (here I remind the reader that luck need not be </span><span class="c2">good luck</span><span class="c0">) must have brought it out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>With the passing of </span><span class="c0">another billion years, my garden will have moved </span><span>a further</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;dozen parsecs away from </span><span>its birth</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cluster. Another billion after that, it will have drifted into the misty halo of stars outside the edge of the galaxy. Eventually (I have not cared to make the calculations) its star will balloon into a red giant</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">before cooling and shedding its mass, layer by layer, into space. These are the questions I can answer. Other things about my </span><span>garden</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;s future remain uncertain. Will life&rsquo;s current incarnation continue to thrive? Or will </span><span>this world</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be rocked by extinctions, resetting its clock, causing a radically different branch of the tree of life to take root? Maybe animals. Maybe from those animals, intelligence. Or maybe the surface of this planet will remain quiet forever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cannot know. What I can know is that surely more worlds like this exist, untouched by </span><span>thought</span><span class="c0">. No </span><span>conscious</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;being </span><span>will ever step foot on</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;those places, </span><span>never there will anyone experience the excruciating joy that is to merely </span><span class="c8">experience</span><span>, to take that small slice of eternity and hold it in one&rsquo;s mind for a while</span><span>. </span><span class="c0">Reality is inherently beautiful</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>B</span><span class="c0">ut true beauty, like a story, </span><span>exists </span><span class="c0">only in the presence of an observer&mdash;and in a universe so vast, there will never be enough observers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Probability tells us that the greatest, most achingly beautiful events will pass by </span><span>unnoted</span><span class="c0">. </span><span>Most places&mdash;physical and temporal&mdash;will never be seen. </span><span class="c0">Consciousness, the universe&rsquo;s tool for observing itself, is too complex to emerge</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">but rarely. Perhaps that it has emerged at all is the true miracle. Life itself is rare enough. On all but a fraction of the billion trillion worlds that dot the expanse, no eyes will ever rise from the muck. And in all but a sliver of the expanse itself, the universe is nothing but void. Particles separated by miles, dancing against a backdrop of uncaring, neverending blackness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I have said that t</span><span class="c0">he universe alone is beautiful. Why should it bother me that so few parts of it will ever arrange themselves in such a way as to be capable of recognizing its beauty? </span><span>Some will</span><span class="c0">&mdash;if you are reading these words, you are one of them. Congratulations. But it will never be enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mostly, the universe is </span><span>silent</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At some point, perhaps long after my death, Librarians will find this message. It will be dutifully incorporated into their archives. Generations of Librarians will pour over it, study it, come to think that they understand it. They will say to themselves, </span><span class="c2">He should have just come back to Nevernues. What better purpose than to do what we can to preserve what</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has </span><span class="c2">been seen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But my revelation is sealed. I cannot unsee it. In the face of the massive flow of information loss, our tiny damn at Nevernues cannot pretend to stop the current. Staring once again at the thousand galaxies in the night sky, I reflect that here we see a parallel with the search for meaning: it is perception, not logic, that matters in the end.</span></p></body></html>
