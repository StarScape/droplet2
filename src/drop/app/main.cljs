;; TODO, F+R: Render hover text different depending on platform
;; TODO: implement highlight part of find and replace

;; BUG: persistent atom causes issues with live-reloading.
;; It's nothing with persistent-atom specifically; something is happening when file loading

;; TODO: when cursor is at or near the bottom of the screen, auto-scroll down to it.
;; Or, an alternative, have a 'locked-on' mode where, when enter is hit, the app always
;; auto-scrolls so that the cursor is the same distance down the screen that it was previously

;; TODO: fullscreen for windows and linux, plus shortcuts for entering and exiting fullscreen
;; TODO: find and replace UI
;; TODO: command palette
;; TODO: learn about React Spring
;; TODO: learn about DataScript
;; TODO: DOCX export/import w/ pandoc

;; TODO: Make so that cmd+i, cmd+b, etc only get added to history when done with a range selection (how much do I care?)
;; TODO: Probably worth breaking out all of the history fns into a protocol and also implementing it for UIState
;; TODO: Copy (and maybe paste) rich text

;; TODO: bug in manual interceptors when upgrading to lastest shadow-cljs; to
;; repro, upgrade shadow-cljs and then fire the save interceptor with cmd+
