;; DONE: Undo broken when trying to undo the insertion of a paragraph.

;; PROG: Copy and paste to/from droplet doc
;; DONE: Bug - select two paragraphs, copy, paste directly after, then press up -- cursor is duplicated incorrectly.
;; DONE: Bug - select list paragraph, copy, paste, then undo results in error thrown
;; DONE: selected-content returns list of Paragraphs when multiple whole paragraphs selected, but list of runs when
;;       a single paragraph is selected in its entirety.
;; DONE: implement cut

;; TODO: Copy and paste to/from outside source
;;   TODO: plain text
;;   TODO: rich text

;; TODO: Find and replace
;; TODO: Nav functions for moving between clauses, sentences, and paragraphs
;; TODO: cmd+shift+right, cmd+shift+left
;; TODO: when _only_ going up and down, support remembering the pixel offset where the up/down operation _began_, instead of
;;       just going up/down from the previous. The remembering should be cancelled if any other operation is performed, including
;;       navigation with left/right arrows, inserting text, etc. Ideally all logic for this should be _confined_ to the up/down (and possibly
;;       left/right) interceptors.
;; TODO: don't fire ' autocomplete if char immediately before or after cursor is alphanumeric,
;; TODO: Investigate fonts that looks good _without_ kerning (Merriweather seems to do well)
;; TODO: Probably worth breaking out all of the history fns into a protocol and also implementing it for UIState
;; TODO: Make so that cmd+i, cmd+b, etc only get added to history when done with a range selection (how much do I care?)
;; TODO: Handle case of click, hold, type some stuff, THEN release
;; TODO: Make a React element that encapsulates the editor. This should live at the app level, not in Slate.
;; TODO: Set up Electron
;; TODO: File saving/loading
;; TODO: Interface design/impl
