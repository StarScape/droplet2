;; DONE: add cmd+left and cmd+right shortcuts to go to start/end of line
;; DONE: Handle resizing of the text area
;; DONE: Handle font resizing of the text area
;; DONE: Add support for h1 and h2
;;   DONE: support rendering h1 and h2 correctly
;;   DONE: fix click and other measurement operations
;;   DONE: selections spanning >2 paragraphs not highlighting between paragraphs correctly, fix
;;   DONE: bug: goto para3 (empty para), shift+up twice, shift+down twice (looks like incorrectly collapsing after first shift+down)
;;   DONE: going down from end of first paragraph (h1) results in cursor way further to the left than it should be
;;   DONE: Bug going up from end of second para (h2)
;;   DONE: make sure tests are fixed
;;   DONE: add interceptors for h1 and h2
;;   WONT: support preserving type on pressing enter

;; TODO: Add support for ordered and unordered lists (prefer using actual <ul> / <ol> elements)
;;   DONE: Render correctly
;;   DONE: Delete correctly (ensure <ul>/<ol> element is removed when last list item is removed)
;;   DONE: Fix enter (currently inserting _above_ the first list-paragraph)
;;   DONE: Update correctly
;;   DONE: Interceptors for ul and ol
;;   TODO: Switching a ul to an ol or viceversa causes an error
;;   TODO: Hitting backspace on an empty paragraph should convert the paragraph to a :body para, not remove it
;;   TODO: Handle up/down operation correctly (account for the fact that lists are offset to the right a bit more)
;;   TODO: Preserve paragraph type on enter, if current paragraph is a list
;;   TODO: De-listify on double enter from list item paragraph (a la everyothertexteditor)

;; TODO: if start of paragraph is a space, shift+option+left won't select that space even when its the only thing left to select
;; TODO: resize works incorrectly when there is an h1 or h2 since they are absolutely sized
;; TODO: when _only_ going up and down, support remembering the pixel offset where the up/down operation _began_, instead of
;;       just going up/down from the previous. The remembering should be cancelled if any other operation is performed, including
;;       navigation with left/right arrows, inserting text, etc. Ideally all logic for this should be _confined_ to the up/down (and possibly
;;       left/right) interceptors.
;; TODO: change measurement ns to cleanup measurement DOM element whenever the font size switched, etc.
;;       We can do this by simple setting the ID of that element to "${uuid-of-editor}-measure-elem", or similar,
;;       and then providing a cleanup function that must be called after the font-size (or any other operation for
;;       which a new measurement-fn must be created). Alternatively, just delete the existing DOM elem each time (ruler-for-elem)
;;       is called. This may actually be less error prone.
;; TODO: Copy and paste
;;   TODO: to/from droplet doc
;;   TODO: to/from outside source
;; TODO: Find and replace
;; TODO: Nav functions for moving between clauses, sentences, and paragraphs
;; TODO: cmd+shift+right, cmd+shift+left
;; TODO: don't fire ' autocomplete if char immediately before or after cursor is alphanumeric,
;; TODO: Investigate fonts that looks good _without_ kerning (Merriweather seems to do well)
;; TODO: Probably worth breaking out all of the history fns into a protocol and also implementing it for UIState
;; TODO: Make so that cmd+i, cmd+b, etc only get added to history when done with a range selection (how much do I care?)
;; TODO: Handle case of click, hold, type some stuff, THEN release
;; TODO: Make a React element that encapsulates the editor. This should live at the app level, not in Slate.
;; TODO: Set up Electron
;; TODO: File saving/loading
;; TODO: Interface design/impl
